# Hello World in Java

This is a simple project that runs a Hello World program in Java.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- JDK 1.8
- Maven 3

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.example.HelloWorld` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
```
Please replace the content inside the shell script with the appropriate command to run your Java application if it's not a Spring Boot application.
